If not, a person must be diagnosed with two or more of the following chronic conditions: asthma, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease, or substance abuse issues. The SMART Program is a collaboration between Housing Works and the NYC Department of Correction (DOC) aimed at reducing the likelihood  of recidivism for detainees in the custody of DOC.  Specifically, the SMART program provides individual and group services to detainees at the Manhattan and Brooklyn Detention Centers, provides assistance with transition from jail to the community and offers community-based services to help stabilize participants. This includes connections to health care, housing, case management and vocational support services. Clients eligible to enroll in the SMART Program must be housed  at Brooklyn and Manhattan Detention Centers; no external referrals are accepted.

Open 24 hours, processes applications 9–5, weekdays. Interpreter assistance will be made available for individuals who do not speak English. Subway: 2/4/5 train to 149th Street/Grand Concourse Station. Head west on East 149th Street toward Grand Concourse. Walk north on Grand Concourse two blocks, to East 151st Street and turn left. Walk two blocks to Walton Avenue. The PATH office is located at the corner on your right. All families who are applying for shelter at PATH must have proper identification for all members of their household, such as: •  Any form of ID with a picture and proof of age, such as a welfare ID card, Green Card, driver’s license, passport or visa, IDNYC, or picture employment card •  Birth certificate •  Social Security card •  Medicaid card •  Identity card in the Public Assistance system •  If working, most recent pay stub Application Process Families with children must apply for shelter in order to ensure that they do not have an alternative housing option available to them. Once a family arrives at PATH, they will first be interviewed by a Human Resources Administration (HRA) caseworker, who will inquire about their living situation and explain the services that may help them avoid entering shelterincluding family mediation, anti-eviction legal services, out-of-city relocation assistance, Family Eviction Prevention Supplement (FEPS), or a deal through HRA. If these services do not apply to a family’s specific circumstances, a DHS family worker interviews the family to obtain information about their prior living situation. Families may be assigned a temporary shelter placement for up to 10 days while DHS investigates the information provided during the interview. DHS determines whether the family is eligible or ineligible for shelter, based on whether they have fully cooperated with the application and eligibility process and/or have other housing options available to them. Every household has a right to a legal conference at PATH if they are found ineligible and disagree with the decision. In addition, they have 60 days after being found ineligible to request a Fair Hearing from New York State. What to Expect Once a family enters shelter, they have certain responsibilities that they must meet, including obtaining and maintaining employment for all those who are able to work. With the assistance of their caseworkers, families will develop an Independent Living Plan (ILP), a document that outlines relevant goals to exit shelter and return to self-sufficiency. Now, more than ever, employment-focused programs and work supports remain a cornerstone of DHS’ efforts to help clients move back to permanency. Through DHS’ policy of Client Responsibility, families in shelter must actively participate in this process and take strides toward independent living.

The criminal practice provides representation in criminal trials and appeals.

An attorney will be appointed to the individual at his or her first hearing. If the individual is not eligible  for a Legal Aid lawyer, he or she can write the supreme court of the county they are in to request court-appointed counsel. If the individual has a parole problem anywhere outside the five boroughs of New York City, one must write to the local court of that area.

Greenhope operates a Residential and Outpatient chemical dependency program for women. It is one of the few woman-centered facilities operating in New York State that serves both parolees and alternative-to-incarceration clients, along with women from the community.

Each youth member who joins Friends gets a youth advocate, who serves as a counselor, mentor, coach, and friend. Interactions begin while youth are still incarcerated and they follow youth into the community. Young people remain engaged with Friends for 1–4 years in varying degrees of intensity, and often stay connected with Friends long after. Individualized, flexible plans for every youth member leverage the specific strengths, talents, interests, resources, and obstacles of each individual.

Each youth member who joins Friends gets a youth advocate, who serves as a counselor, mentor, coach, and friend. Interactions begin while youth are still incarcerated and they follow youth into the community. Young people remain engaged with Friends for 1–4 years in varying degrees of intensity, and often stay connected with Friends long after. Individualized, flexible plans for every youth member leverage the specific strengths, talents, interests, resources, and obstacles of each individual.

Each youth member who joins Friends gets a youth advocate, who serves as a counselor, mentor, coach, and friend. Interactions begin while youth are still incarcerated and they follow youth into the community. Young people remain engaged with Friends for 1–4 years in varying degrees of intensity, and often stay connected with Friends long after. Individualized, flexible plans for every youth member leverage the specific strengths, talents, interests, resources, and obstacles of each individual.
