JLUSA engages formerly incarcerated individuals to help build support and raise awareness through advocacy and activism. JLUSA runs Leading with Conviction (LwC), an advanced leadership training  for formerly incarcerated, mid-senior level leaders with a specific and proven track record in advocacy and community organizing. LwC is a cohort-based, 12-month opportunity for leaders from around the country. LwC takes place both in-person and remotely through in-person forums, webinars, executive coaching, peer coaching, and regular digital communication. For those with less leadership experience,  JLUSA offers Emerging Leaders Trainings to formerly incarcerated people (at least one year from release of previous incarceration) committed to systemic criminal and juvenile justice reform. The Emerging Leaders Training introduces principles of responsibility, self-reflection and collective leadership, communication skills, and professional relationship effectiveness. Contact JLUSA for information about leadership training, organizational membership, and volunteer opportunities. ",

Health Communities aim to raise the self-esteem of people in prison through faith-based group counseling so they are better able to address the challenges facing them inside and upon release. Community support meetings help formerly incarcerated men and women adjust to parole offi-  cers, their new role in their families, their search for employment,  and other issues surrounding reentry. Participants experience a recidivism rate of 7 percent compared to the state average of 36 percent. In-prison programs are located at Green Haven, Wallkill, Queensboro, Taconic, Bedford Hills, Edgecombe, and Vernon C. Bain Center (Rikers Island). Opportunities to become a trained facilitator and mentor are available. Call for meeting locations in the Bronx, Manhattan, and Queens. ",

The Care Management Team will provide assistance with connecting to medical, mental, dental and substance use services. Support and referrals are offered to obtain entitlements, education, legal services, job, food, transportation and housing needs.  Health Home eligibility requires a person to be HIV positive or have a mental health diagnosis. If not, a person must be diagnosed with two or more of the following chronic conditions: asthma, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease, or substance abuse issues. The SMART Program is a collaboration between Housing Works and the NYC Department of Correction (DOC) aimed at reducing the likelihood  of recidivism for detainees in the custody of DOC.  Specifically, the SMART program provides individual and group services to detainees at the Manhattan and Brooklyn Detention Centers, provides assistance with transition from jail to the community and offers community-based services to help stabilize participants. This includes connections to health care, housing, case management and vocational support services. Clients eligible to enroll in the SMART Program must be housed  at Brooklyn and Manhattan Detention Centers; no external referrals are accepted. The target population for this project is adult males (22 years and older). ",

Open 24 hours, processes applications 9\u20135, weekdays. Interpreter assistance will be made available for individuals who do not speak English. Subway: 2/4/5 train to 149th Street/Grand Concourse Station. Head west on East 149th Street toward Grand Concourse. Walk north on Grand Concourse two blocks, to East 151st Street and turn left. Walk two blocks to Walton Avenue. The PATH office is located at the corner on your right. All families who are applying for shelter at PATH must have proper identification for all members of their household, such as: \u2022  Any form of ID with a picture and proof of age, such as a welfare ID card, Green Card, driver\u2019s license, passport or visa, IDNYC, or picture employment card \u2022  Birth certificate \u2022  Social Security card \u2022  Medicaid card \u2022  Identity card in the Public Assistance system \u2022  If working, most recent pay stub Application Process Families with children must apply for shelter in order to ensure that they do not have an alternative housing option available to them. Once a family arrives at PATH, they will first be interviewed by a Human Resources Administration (HRA) caseworker, who will inquire about their living situation and explain the services that may help them avoid entering shelterincluding family mediation, anti-eviction legal services, out-of-city relocation assistance, Family Eviction Prevention Supplement (FEPS), or a deal through HRA. If these services do not apply to a family\u2019s specific circumstances, a DHS family worker interviews the family to obtain information about their prior living situation. Families may be assigned a temporary shelter placement for up to 10 days while DHS investigates the information provided during the interview. DHS determines whether the family is eligible or ineligible for shelter, based on whether they have fully cooperated with the application and eligibility process and/or have other housing options available to them. Every household has a right to a legal conference at PATH if they are found ineligible and disagree with the decision. In addition, they have 60 days after being found ineligible to request a Fair Hearing from New York State. What to Expect Once a family enters shelter, they have certain responsibilities that they must meet, including obtaining and maintaining employment for all those who are able to work. With the assistance of their caseworkers, families will develop an Independent Living Plan (ILP), a document that outlines relevant goals to exit shelter and return to self-sufficiency. Now, more than ever, employment-focused programs and work supports remain a cornerstone of DHS\u2019 efforts to help clients move back to permanency. Through DHS\u2019 policy of Client Responsibility, families in shelter must actively participate in this process and take strides toward independent living. Families are expected to cooperate in developing and completing their ILP, which includes steps toward obtaining permanent housing: \u2022  Applying for Public Assistance (PA) and completing all requirements necessary for establishing and maintaining eligibility for PA benefits \u2022  If able to work, actively seeking employment and accepting a suitable job offer when it is offered \u2022  Working closely with their caseworker or housing specialist to locate and view available apartments \u2022  Actively seeking permanent housing by viewing available apartments several times per week ",

Anyone who has been incarcerated and has questions about medical/mental health treatment they received while in jail can call CHS for info. Located across the street from the Rikers Island Bridge, the CHS Assistance Center is a one-stop location to help connect people leaving jail or their families to free or low cost services, insurance enrollment and affordable health care. CHS Assistance Center is open Mon.\u2013Fri. 9\u20135. The Assistance Center does not provide medications. Someone receiving medication for any kind of condition while incarcerated can get a referral and a prescription as part of their discharge plan and can pick up their medication at a local pharmacy. Hepatitis C New York City initiates treatment for hepatitis C while patients are incarcerated, or continues treatment for those who enter jail during treatment. When a patient is discharged before they have finished their treatment regimen, CHS will refer them to community providers to ensure continuity of treatment. Substance Use New York City operates a jail-based Medication Assisted Treatment program for opioid dependent patients. Training and naloxone kits are available to people visiting loved ones on Rikers Island. Patients receiving either Methadone or Buprenorphine in jail will be referred to community providers upon release to continue treatment. Health Insurance For people who had active Medicaid coverage or had a Medicaid application submitted prior to incarceration, CHS works with the New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA) to activate their coverage as soon as possible after discharge. CHS can assist with first-time medicaid applications. CHS partners with MetroPlus, NYC Health + Hospitals\u2019 Health Plan, to enroll visiting friends and family members in health insurance at the Rikers Island Visitors\u2019 Center. Community Reentry Assistant Network (CRAN) Under the Community Reentry Assistance Network (CRAN), all patients who receive legally-mandated discharge planning services prior to leaving city jails now have a single point of entry to an array of services, including services for patients diagnosed with a serious mental illness. CRAN will provide assistance with benefit enrollment, housing, and linkages to medical services. A person has to have been in the mental health service in order to receive CRAN services.  For more information please call the offices listed below. ",

When reviewing cases they focus on forms of weak evidence that have recently proven unreliable such as mistaken eyewitnesses, false confessions, police misconduct, and perjury.

It will help clients obtain their rap sheet (arrest and conviction record) and provide information on how to clean up one\u2019s rap sheet (seal records, correct inaccuracies, and obtain Certificates of Relief from Disabilities and Certificates of Good Conduct from the courts). It will also counsel clients on their rights when seeking employment. For those who feel they have been unfairly discriminated against as a formerly incarcerated person, or for those who want information on how to obtain bonding for a particular job, the Legal Action Center can be of help. It also offers advice and representation on a range of legal problems for people with HIV infection and their families, past and current substance abusers, women, and children. Individuals should keep a copy of their prison release papers as they might prove useful in becoming eligible for certain benefits or programs. If they are lost, people formerly incarcerated in state facilities can write to those facilities for copies. Those formerly incarcerated in New York City may call 311 and ask for Inmate Jail Release Services. ",

It is divided into a civil practice, a criminal defense practice, and a juvenile rights practice. The civil practice represents low-income families and individuals in legal matters involving housing, benefits, disability, domestic violence, family issues, health, employment, immigration, HIV/AIDS, prisoners\u2019 rights, and elder law. The criminal practice provides representation in criminal trials and appeals. The juvenile rights practice provides representation for children who appear before the family court in matters involving child protective proceedings, juvenile delinquency, people in need of supervision (PINS), and in appellate cases involving children. If a person is charged with violating the conditions of his or her release, the Legal Aid Society\u2019s Parole Revocation Defense Unit provides legal representation and social work diversion services to the indigent parolee population. An attorney will be appointed to the individual at his or her first hearing. If the individual is not eligible  for a Legal Aid lawyer, he or she can write the supreme court of the county they are in to request court-appointed counsel. If the individual has a parole problem anywhere outside the five boroughs of New York City, one must write to the local court of that area. ",

After incarceration, women come to the WPA for help building the lives  they want for themselves and their families. The WPA partners with women to find safe and affordable housing, prepare for job interviews and obtain employment, reunify with their children, comply with criminal justice mandates, access addiction, health, and mental health services, and gain peer support. Women and their allies seeking partnership should ask for the Community Linkage Unit when they call, email, or walk in. Open 24 hours a day. ",

Greenhope operates a Residential and Outpatient chemical dependency program for women. It is one of the few woman-centered facilities operating in New York State that serves both parolees and alternative-to-incarceration clients, along with women from the community. Greenhope operates Kandake House, a state-of-the-art green building for mothers and children (0 to 5 years) at risk of incarceration or having child removed from care. Participants work on their addiction and health challenges while forging bonds of attachment with their children. Greenhope is now affiliated with Acacia Network. Walk-ins are welcome. ",

Interactions begin while youth are still incarcerated and they follow youth into the community. Young people remain engaged with Friends for 1\u20134 years in varying degrees of intensity, and often stay connected with Friends long after. Individualized, flexible plans for every youth member leverage the specific strengths, talents, interests, resources, and obstacles of each individual. Among Friends\u2019 many services are counseling, leadership training, alternative education including HSE preparation, and arts and recreation. Friends offers fatherhood programs for both young men (16\u201324) and adults (25 and older). ",

Each youth member who joins Friends gets a youth advocate, who serves as a counselor, mentor, coach, and friend. Interactions begin while youth are still incarcerated and they follow youth into the community. Young people remain engaged with Friends for 1\u20134 years in varying degrees of intensity, and often stay connected with Friends long after. Individualized, flexible plans for every youth member leverage the specific strengths, talents, interests, resources, and obstacles of each individual. Among Friends\u2019 many services are counseling, leadership training, alternative education including HSE preparation, and arts and recreation. Friends offers fatherhood programs for both young men (16\u201324) and adults (25 and older). ",

Each youth member who joins Friends gets a youth advocate, who serves as a counselor, mentor, coach, and friend. Interactions begin while youth are still incarcerated and they follow youth into the community. Young people remain engaged with Friends for 1\u20134 years in varying degrees of intensity, and often stay connected with Friends long after. Individualized, flexible plans for every youth member leverage the specific strengths, talents, interests, resources, and obstacles of each individual. Among Friends\u2019 many services are counseling, leadership training, alternative education including HSE preparation, and arts and recreation. Friends offers fatherhood programs for both young men (16\u201324) and adults (25 and older). ",

In partnership with the Department of Youth and Community Development, PAL places youth aged 14\u201324 in summer employment. This includes court-involved youth (in both juvenile and criminal court), homeless youth, and youth involved in the ACS foster care system.

Each youth member who joins Friends gets a youth advocate, who serves as a counselor, mentor, coach, and friend. Interactions begin while youth are still incarcerated and they follow youth into the community. Young people remain engaged with Friends for 1\u20134 years in varying degrees of intensity, and often stay connected with Friends long after. Individualized, flexible plans for every youth member leverage the specific strengths, talents, interests, resources, and obstacles of each individual. Among Friends\u2019 many services are counseling, leadership training, alternative education including HSE preparation, and arts and recreation. Friends offers fatherhood programs for both young men (16\u201324) and adults (25 and older). ",
